Games lots are the only place you can find the Casino objects, that let you and other players roll the dice to either win big or hit rock bottom. These include Slots, Blackjack, and Roulette, the latter two can be played with up to four players at a time. Games lot owners will likely also host their own events, which makes them a great place to have some fun with your Simoleons or even for free. You're free to bet as much or as little as you wish to set your own jackpot, though the casino owners will likely be hoping you don't win it and shut down their machines! \n\nMotives: [s][color=#B3FF99]Easy[/color][/s], Speciality: [s]Casino Objects[/s]"
