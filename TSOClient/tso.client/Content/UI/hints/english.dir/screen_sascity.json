    "body": "Before you create your first Sim, choose where you would like this Sim to live. Your Sim will live their entire life in the city you choose. If you plan on playing with real-life friends, ask them which city their Sim is on so you can create a Sim on that city too. Each city can have thousands of residents and can develop into unique communities, depending on the Sims who live there. The game rules are the same for all cities, so you may want to pick one that sounds interesting to you.
