    "body": "Welcome to Nate's Lunchatorium, authentically serving you authentic lunch with the same authentic grills and authentic grease since 1932! Your job is to wait on visiting Sims, improve their mood, and get them on their way.\n\nWhen a Sim enters the restaurant, they will seat themselves. Once they're seated, you can [s][color=white]TAKE AN ORDER[/color][/s]. You'll get a ticket. Deliver that ticket to the P.O.S. register (that's 'Point of Sale', in case you were wondering), and the cooks in the kitchen will get straight to work on filling your order â€“ that is, if they're not slacking off. If they are, give 'em a nudge to get 'em started again.\n\nMeanwhile, you can interact with patrons to improve their mood. Happy Sims are big tippers, but don't push your luck. If you pester people (or ignore them), they're likely to leave without paying.\n\nRemember, every good lunch starts with 'lunchatorium'! That's Nate's Lunchatorium, conveniently located next to the SimCity General Hospital and the CDC."
