Shopping lots are very different from most other properties in the game - it's the owner's job to buy catalog objects in bulk at a discounted price, and then sell them to you for cheaper than the catalog offers. Objects that are for sale are physically present on the property, just hover over them to see the price compared to their catalog value.\n\nShopping lots also have another trick up their sleeve - they're the only properties you can buy additional clothes from! Look around for some clothes racks, and 'Browse' them to see what's in stock. New clothes are a little premium in The Sims Online, so don't faint at the price!\n\nThere's nothing stopping anyone from hanging out on a shopping lot, so feel free to loiter around and chat. Shopping lots still appear on the Top 100, after all. \n\nMotives: [s][color=#FFA64D]Average[/color][/s], Speciality: [s]Can buy objects at wholesale prices and sell them to other players, Clothes Racks.[/s]"
