On this lot type, players on accounts younger than a week old earn twice the money and skills than they would at other non-money/skills lot type (including group objects)... However, older accounts will have their skills disabled entirely! You'll also find a lot of helpful hands around here - people who want to help you get started, and perhaps future friends or roomies. Hosts gain 3x the Visitor Bonus for hosting properties of this type - so charity has never been more profitable. \n\nMotives: [s][color=#B3FF99]Easy[/color][/s], Speciality: [s]Boosted Group Money Objects + skills for new players.[/s] \n[s][color=white]Visitor Bonus: 3x[/color][/s]\n[s][color=#FF9999]Skills are always disabled on this property category for visitors over a week old.[/color][/s]"
